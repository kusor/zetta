= Zetta, Ruby bindings for ZFS

Zetta is a C library interface to ZFS, Sun's shiny new Zettabyte File System,
which made its debut in OpenSolaris. Apparently now, ports are abound to the
stable Solaris 10 release, FreeBSD and the upcoming Mac OS X release. So some
Ruby rock star will have to write an interface to use it or the Ruby hordes
will be left behind!  And we can't have that!

*Please read my mind to discover how this library works until I deign to write
some better documentation.*

*Note:* I may have used _why and beer as inspiration whilst writing some of this documentation.
